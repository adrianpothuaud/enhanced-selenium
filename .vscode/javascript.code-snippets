	// Place your o5r-e2e workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
  "Comments for test": {
    "scope": "javascript",
    "prefix": "comment",
    "body": [
      "// (1)---------------setup",
      "// # 🌱 Beginning of the times, there were nothing at all",
      "// (2)--------------action",
      "// # 💍 The proposal...",
      "// (3)---------------tests",
      "// # 🕵️ Finished works inspector comes in!",
      "// 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 ",
    ]
  },
  "Jest new it block": {
    "scope": "javascript",
    "prefix": "it",
    "body": [
      "it('$1', async () => {",
      "  // (1)---------------setup",
      "  // # 🌱 Beginning of the times, there were nothing at all",
      "  // (2)--------------action",
      "  // # 💍 The proposal...",
      "  // (3)---------------tests",
      "  // # 🕵️ Finished works inspector comes in!",
      "  // 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 ",
      "}, $2)",
